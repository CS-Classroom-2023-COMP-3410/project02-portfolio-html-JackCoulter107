Working on this project was fun and sometimes challenging. It took me awhile to find a style that felt like "me" when having to program (or ask ChatGBT) to make very small changes. Then after finding what I liked organizing the content across multiple pages in a way that felt cohesive and engaging was challenging. Balancing creativity with readability was tricky, especially with a basic HTML-only setup, but keeping the layout simple helped.

Another challenge was making the contact page better. It felt too minimal at first, so I added more contact options and some fun details like social media links (even though they're fake). Finding the right way to integrate Google Maps links for locations was also a bit tricky, but simplifying it with a search-based approach made it word. Overall, it was a great learning experience, but may have been overshawdows by the tool we have at times.
